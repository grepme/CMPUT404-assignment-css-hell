Part 1
======
76-h.html is the only one with images.

The default CSS was left in place that was downloaded alongside the HTML. However, for the assignment, 
certain styles were overwritten to meet the criteria.

The only thing added to the HTML document was:
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css" />

AND, the figcaption for 76-h.html:
<figcaption>Something Something Caption</figcaption>

After the default style tag.

"Aesthetically Pleasing"... uhhh, it looks good against the background already.
With the background as #D1BA98 from the paper, #726F92 is considered on the opposite side of the spectrum from:

Using a triad colour scheme so that the text colour stands out from the background more.

"Image caption". There really was no image captions in my story. However, if there was, we could use figcaption 
from HTML 5. I've accounted for this and added styling for it. Look for it in 76-h.html:
<figcaption>Something Something Caption</figcaption>

Vintage paper background was acquired from here:
